In the summer of 2019 I was graced with the opportunity to work in a rural part of Alaska as a crew member for one of the largest fishing/recreational campground in Alaska. On top of beautiful scenery everyone that I worked with was so nice, and I was able to form life long friendships.

Towards the middle of the summer, late June early July, a little west of where I was staying, Cooper Landing, there were severe forest fires which had serious impacts on air quality. However bad these fires seemed to be at the moment it was a great lesson to learn that these fires are essential for moose and caribou populations. The fires burn down old tough shrubbery and allow room for new young shrubs to grow. The newer shrubs are what the moose and caribou find most delicious.
